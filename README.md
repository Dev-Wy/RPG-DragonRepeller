## Overview
- This is Role Playing Game that works with arrays, strings, objects, functions, loops, if/else statements, and more. Rescue the local town from monsters that have moved into a nearby cave. Purchase various weapons from the store. Can you find the hidden treasure trove on your quest?

## My Process
### Built with
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

### What I learned
- This project refreshed my JavaScript knowledge and helped me connect how each part works it build on each other as the JS fills out. I like the game master's hidden easter egg idea. 

### Continued development
- I enjoyed adding some flare to the basic CSS. I'd like to be able to add in pictures to go along with the changing locations. I would also like to change the number of buttons featured when only one is necessary verses the general three.
